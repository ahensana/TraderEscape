# OTP Verification & Forgot Password Setup

This document explains how to set up and use the OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality that has been added to your TraderEscape application.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Database Setup
Run the setup script to add the necessary database fields:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\TraderEscape

# Run the setup script
php setup_otp.php
```

Or manually run the SQL commands in `add_otp_fields.sql` in your database.

### 2. Email Configuration
The system uses PHP's built-in `mail()` function. For local development with XAMPP:

1. **Enable PHP Mail (if not already enabled):**
   - Edit `php.ini` in your XAMPP installation
   - Uncomment and configure:
   ```ini
   [mail function]
   SMTP = localhost
   smtp_port = 25
   sendmail_from = your-email@domain.com
   ```

2. **For Production:** Consider using email services like:
   - SendGrid (free tier: 100 emails/day)
   - Mailgun (free tier: 5,000 emails/month)
   - AWS SES (very affordable)
   - Gmail SMTP (with app passwords)
